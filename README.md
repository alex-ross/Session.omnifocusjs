# Session.omnifocusjs

## Start a Session

Start a Session in the session app with the project and task name as intent. If the task has a estimated duration it will start the session with that duration instead of the default 25 minutes. If their is a root folder for your Omnifocus project that is an exact match for a Session category it will start the Session in that category.

This is based on the Start a Session action in [wxxedu/OmniFocus-Today (version 1.20)](https://github.com/wxxedu/OmniFocus-Today)
